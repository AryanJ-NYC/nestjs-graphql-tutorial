# NestJS GraphQL Tutorial

This repository complements my [Stand Up a Node.js Server with NestJS including TypeScript and GraphQL tutorial](https://www.thewebdevcoach.com/stand-up-a-node-js-server-with-nestjs-including-typescript-and-graphql).

To see it up and running:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start:dev`
3. Go to http://localhost:3000/graphql
4. Run either the `messages` query or `createMessage` as described in the tutorial
